# War Card Game

Welcome to the War Card Game repository! This is a simple iOS app I created for fun, inspired by the classic card game of War. While this app was made for personal enjoyment, I wanted to share it with others on GitHub and possibly feature it on my resume.

## Game Overview

The War Card Game is a digital version of the classic card game "War," where you play against the computer. The rules are simple:

- There are two sides: the player's side and the CPU's side.
- Press the "Deal" button to flip cards on both sides.
- The side with the higher card wins the round and earns a point.
- The game continues until you decide to stop.

## Features

- Intuitive user interface that replicates the game's real-life experience.
- Random card flipping to add an element of chance.
- Basic scoring system to keep track of wins against the CPU.
- Designed and coded for iOS using Swift and SwiftUI.
